/**
 * A name of a human with text, parts and usage information. Names may be changed or repudiated. People may have different
 * names in different contexts. Names may be divided into parts of different type that have variable significance depending
 * on context, though the division into parts is not always significant. With personal names, the different parts might
 * or might not be imbued with some implicit meaning; various cultures associate different importance with the name parts
 * and the degree to which systems SHALL care about name parts around the world varies widely.
