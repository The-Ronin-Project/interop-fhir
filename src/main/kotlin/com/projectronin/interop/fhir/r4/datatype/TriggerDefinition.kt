/**
 * The TriggerDefinition structure defines when a knowledge artifact is expected to be evaluated. The structure can
 * represent three main kinds of triggering events, depending on the value of type:
 *
 * - Named Event
 * - Scheduled Event
 * - Data Event
 *
 * A named event is an event identified by the implementation environment. This allows any event generated within the
 * implementation environment to be used as a trigger, but it requires pre-coordination of the names involved with the
 * consuming environments. HL7 v2 events are assigned the URI http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0003#```[code]```
 * e.g. http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0003/A01, and reference any data change that would trigger the sending
 * of the matching HL7 v2 version, if the application providing the FHIR API supports v2 events internally.
 *
 * A scheduled event occurs on a fixed or periodic schedule.
 *
 * And finally, a data event occurs in response to some data-related event in the integrated environment such as a
 * record being added or updated. The data-of-interest for a data event is described using a DataRequirement. This allows
 * for systems to automatically invoke based on data activity occurring within the system. A condition may also be
 * specified to further refine the trigger
